# TLDR

My skills, experience, and employment history in a nutshell.

## Experience

### Language Ecosystems

- Java: Since version 1. Name any major language or framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and I've probably
  worked professionally with it. For example, Kotlin and Spring.
- JavaScript: Since before it was called JavaScript. I've worked with most of the frontend frameworks, and some of the
  backend. I work professionally with TypeScript and React, for example.
- .NET: Only during its more recent renaissance. As an architect, with a modest amount of hands-on C#.
- Python: Only during its recent rise as a platform for data science. A smidge as an integration orchestrator.
- Ruby: As a DevOps and sometimes Web UI tool.

I dabble non-professionally in C++, Go, and Rust.

### OS Ecosystems

- Linux: Since forever, as this is obviously the key dev and hosting platform. I am proficient in the Bash shell and
  have worked in most major distributions over the years. Not that it's relevant anymore, but in the way-back I also
  worked with most major Unix distributions (Solaris, Informix, etc.), and even did hardware infrastructure planning for
  these.
- macOS: As a dev environment, since 2011. Presently the most frictionless dev environment, with its *nix compliance and
  bash/zsh. I've long been a proponent, but ...
- Windows: In the last few years I've shifted
  to [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). I don't do Windows-native
  dev, so why? In general, Microsoft has been innovating (in my ecosystems at least) where Apple has not. It's just more
  exciting to be where things feel a little fresher. Furthermore, it's conceptually closer to
  [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)) --
  so it keeps me in a headspace where I'm always ready to solve the same kinds of challenges.

### Cloud Ecosystems

- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Since 2010 this has been my main professional deployment environment. Naturally, I've
  worked with many of their sub-systems and services.

I've dabbled in Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Heroku, and more.
