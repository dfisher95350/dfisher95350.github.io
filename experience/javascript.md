My `javascript` repository is a collection of JavaScript and TypeScript examples that demonstrate language features, techniques, and patterns. Tests with Mocha.
                              
My professional experience with JavaScript dates back to LiveWire in the Netscape Enterprise Server (1997).

My first experience with JavaScript was in 1997, with LiveWire in the Netscape Enterprise Server. Netscape provided both technology and funding to launch mpr.org (Minnesota Public Radio) -- particularly to create a Web presence for, and netcast of, A Prairie Home Companion. Ironically, LiveWire was a server-side programming environment -- while at the same time, Java was being used for browser-based "applets".
