# Experience

Here you'll find a general overview of my technical experience and interests. For a detailed, chronological view, see my [Employment](../employment) and [Education](../education) histories.

## General

I've been designing, recommending, and making technical architecture decisions for twenty years. My chief expertise is in designing and building **Software-as-a-Service** (SaaS) applications, but my consulting experience includes even hardware infrastructure.

Furthermore, my tenure guiding the development of an **Enterprise Architecture** product has given me special insight into that practice and body of knowledge.

On GitHub:

- **notebook** - A private repository of documents and notes on general topics in technology: concepts, patterns, providers, resources, standards, and tools.

## Dev

My professional experience revolves chiefly around the ecosystems of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and **JavaScript**. Happily, these ecosystems are _extremely rich_ and still evolving. My work has kept me hands-on with the most relevant technologies in both spaces from 1996 to the present.

- My professional experience with **Java** dates back to applets in version 1 (1996). 
- My professional experience with **JavaScript** dates back to LiveWire in the Netscape Enterprise Server (1997).

On GitHub:

- **java** - A private repository of all things JVM, from **Akka** to **ZooKeeper**. Polyglot (includes **Kotlin**, **Groovy**, **Scala**, and **Clojure**).
- **javascript** - This private repository includes projects and exercises that leverage languages and frameworks like **TypeScript** and **React**.
- **cpp** - A private repository for C++ study.
- **data** - A private repository for data science, data stores (**MySQL**, **Neo4j**, etc.), and data structures (**JSON**, **GraphQL**, etc.).
- **dotnet** - A private repository for .NET study, particularly **.NET Core** on Linux and macOS. Includes **C#** and **F#**.
- **go** - A private repository for Go study.
- **python** - A private repository for Python study.
- **ruby** - A private repository for Ruby study.
- **rust** - A private repository for Rust study.
- **unity** - A private repository of Unity tutorials.

## DevOps

I have long professional experience with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, including **Chef** in OpsWorks. My chief interest in this area revolves around what these technologies mean for packaging and delivering components in repeatable, standards-based fashion. You'll see that reflected in my repositories here.

On GitHub:

- **docker** - A private repository containing configurations for test and study.
- **kubernetes** - A private repository containing configurations for test and study.
- **maven** - A private repository used to bootstrap feature-rich, polyglot projects for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Lays a foundation that includes a whole lotta **Spring** (including **Spring Boot**).
- **vagrant** - This private repository contains a small collection of Vagrant box configurations for personal development environments. Portable across platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux). Boxes are versioned and stored in AWS S3.
