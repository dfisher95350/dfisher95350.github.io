# Resume

The shorter version (TLDR).
My skills, experience, employment, and education in a nutshell.

## Skills

Abilities where positive feedback says I've been able to make exceptional contributions.

- Bridging the gap. Software product development is the discipline of translating product needs into technical
  implementation. Reducing friction at this boundary is a distinct competitive and innovative advantage. And yet product
  and technical disciplines are traditionally silo'd. Most people don't even _want_ to have expertise in both. I
  understand and appreciate both disciplines.
- Depth and breadth. Adapt communications and contributions appropriate to the current audience or situation, from
  hands-on pair programming to high-level board presentations. Useful in the weeds. Useful at ten-thousand feet.
- Keeping it fresh. Don't plan to solutions but rather to solution vectors, so that technology choices can always be
  evolving in a forward direction.
- Keeping it real. Use pragmatic, proven technical solutions for real-world problems. Make smart build v buy decisions.
- Making it personal. Customers matter. Encourage direct interaction and make it as enjoyable as possible for everyone,
  particularly for developers who don't always love this aspect of the job. Nurture a sense of responsibility and
  respect.
- Mentoring. Quality developers don't need hand-holding, but they do need to be set up for success. They need help
  setting meaningful goals and expectations. They need help identifying the most productive tools (and patterns) for
  their toolboxes.

## Experience

### Management

All the things that go into managing product development at
an [Independent Software Vendor (ISV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor).

- Agile. Although the [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) Manifesto was first published in
  2001, it was an expression of the development climate of the late 90s. As such, the Agile methodology has been
  standard operating procedure throughout my career.
- Compliance. Experience with high-level procedural audits, such as
  [ISO 27001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001),
  [SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_and_Organization_Controls). Experience with implementation-level standards,
  such as
  [OWASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP),
  [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth),
  [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language).
- Continuous Deployment. More than a decade of authoring and managing deployments in the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  ecosystem.
- Continuous Integration. A long history of designing, implementing, and managing technical solutions and procedures
  around various popular continuous integration systems, most recently GitHub Actions.
- Planning. Very familiar with Agile planning tools and techniques. Experience in Enterprise Architecture provides an
  additional layer of experience, in frameworks such as
  [BIZBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_architecture),
  [COBIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT),
  [ITIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL),
  [ITSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management),
  and [PMBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge).
- Product Management. Experience implementing the [Pragmatic Marketing](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/) product
  development framework.
- Project Management. A long history of documenting, prioritizing, and managing, with tools such as Atlassian suite (
  Jira), etc.
- Quality Assurance (QA). A long history of designing, implementing, and managing technical solutions and procedures
  around various popular unit testing and Quality Assurance (QA) frameworks, e.g. JUnit, Jest, Selenium, TestRail.
- Version Control. A long history of designing and managing solutions and procedures around various popular version
  control and artifact management systems, including of course Git and GitHub.

### Languages

Hands-on object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and functional programming (and the design of complex systems that leverage
each), from the late 90s and continuing through the present.

- Java, since version 1. Name any major language or framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and I've probably
  worked professionally with it. For example, Kotlin and Spring.
- JavaScript, since before it was called JavaScript. I've worked with most of the frontend frameworks, and some of the
  backend. I work with TypeScript and React, for example.
- To a lesser extent, I've also worked professionally in the .NET (C#), Python, and Ruby ecosystems.
- I dabble in C++, Go, and Rust. Way back I did Perl professionally.

### Data

The catch-phrase, "data-driven", has never been more relevant as the present. A staple of my career, and the aspect of
software product development I care most about.

- SQL-compliant databases, since 1998. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM Db2, IBM Informix, etc.
- [Document stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) (particularly
  for [large-scale search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_search) solutions), since 2000. Apache Lucene,
  Apache Solr, Elasticsearch.
- [Graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) (Neo4j, Cypher) since 2015.
- Object-relational (ORM) frameworks (e.g. Hibernate, Spring Data), since 2002.
- Business Intelligence tools and frameworks (e.g. Tableau).
- Data visualization (e.g. D3).
- I dabble in data science (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Anaconda) and machine-learning (e.g. TensorFlow).

### Architecture

Advanced to "technical architect" early in my career, and have been designing systems ever since.

- Software Design. Frameworks, applications, platforms. Using
  [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language),
  [ERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model),
  [BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_modeling), etc. since 1998. Most often with hands-on
  proofs-of-concept.
- Enterprise Architecture. Experience as both a consultant and the manager of an EA SaaS product. Familiar with TOGAF
  and similar guiding frameworks.
- Virtual Infrastructure. Hands-on experience designing and implementing solutions in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker,
  Kubernetes, Vagrant. VMware before that.
- Physical Infrastructure. Even today comes in handy when understanding
  cloud-based [hypervisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) and threading models.

### Operating Systems

- Linux, of course. I've worked with most major distributions since the mid-to-late 90s.
POSIX-compliant macOS since 2010. 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) since 2020.
- In the way-back I worked with most major flavors of Unix (including hardware infrastructure planning).

### Cloud

- Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since 2010 this has been my main professional deployment environment. Of course this means
  that I've worked with many of their sub-systems and services.
- I've dabbled in Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Heroku, and others.

## Employment

In a nutshell, I've been a technical leader (architect, chief technologist, manager) since I really found my feet at SPS
Commerce, circa 2000. I've been building Web applications since 1995, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) since 1998, and
cloud-based (e.g. Amazon Web Services) systems since 2010.
