# TLDR

My skills, experience, employment, and education in a nutshell.

## Skills

- Bridging the gap.
- Keeping it fresh. Don't plan to solutions but rather to solution vectors, so that technology choices can always be
  evolving in a forward direction.
- Keeping it real. Use pragmatic, proven technical solutions for real-world problems. Make smart build v buy decisions.
- Making it personal.
- Hands-on
- Mentoring.

## Experience

### Management

All the things that go into managing product development at an [Independent Software Vendor (ISV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor).

- Agile. Although the [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) Manifesto was first published in
  2001, it was an expression of the development climate of the late 90s. As such, the Agile methodology has been
  standard operating procedure throughout my career.
- Compliance. Experience with high-level procedural audits, such as
  [ISO 27001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001),
  [SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_and_Organization_Controls). Experience with implementation-level standards,
  such as
  [OWASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP),
  [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth),
  [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language).
- Continuous Deployment. More than a decade of authoring and managing deployments in the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  ecosystem.
- Continuous Integration. A long history of designing, implementing, and managing technical solutions and procedures
  around various popular continuous integration systems, most recently GitHub Actions.
- Planning. Very familiar with Agile planning tools and techniques. Experience in Enterprise Architecture provides an
  additional layer of experience, in frameworks such as
  [BIZBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_architecture),
  [COBIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT),
  [ITIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL),
  [ITSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management),
  and [PMBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge).
- Product Management. Experience implementing the [Pragmatic Marketing](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/) product
  development framework.
- Project Management. A long history of documenting, prioritizing, and managing, with tools such as Atlassian suite (
  Jira), etc.
- Quality Assurance (QA). A long history of designing, implementing, and managing technical solutions and procedures
  around various popular unit testing and Quality Assurance (QA) frameworks, e.g. JUnit, Jest, Selenium, TestRail.
- Version Control. A long history of designing and managing solutions and procedures around various popular version
  control and artifact management systems, including of course Git and GitHub.

### Languages

The heart of my background is object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and functional programming (and designing complex
systems that leverage each), from the late 90s and continuing through the present.

- Java, since version 1. Name any major language or framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and I've probably
  worked professionally with it. For example, Kotlin and Spring.
- JavaScript, since before it was called JavaScript. I've worked with most of the frontend frameworks, and some of the
  backend. I work with TypeScript and React, for example.
- To a lesser extent, I've also worked professionally in the .NET (C#), Python, and Ruby ecosystems.
- I dabble in C++, Go, and Rust. Way back I did Perl professionally.

### Data

The catch-phrase, "data-driven", has never been more relevant as the present. It's been a staple of my career, and the
aspect of software product development I care most about.

- SQL-compliant databases, since 1998. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM Db2, IBM Informix, etc.
- [Document stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) (particularly
  for [large-scale search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_search) solutions), since 2000. Apache Lucene,
  Apache Solr, Elasticsearch.
- [Graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) (Neo4j, Cypher) since 2015.
- Object-relational (ORM) frameworks (e.g. Hibernate, Spring Data), since 2002.
- Business Intelligence tools and frameworks (e.g. Tableau).
- Data visualization (e.g. D3).
- I dabble in data science (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Anaconda) and machine-learning (e.g. TensorFlow).

### Architecture

- design I am familiar with both the TOGAF and UML frameworks.

### Operating Systems

- Linux, of course. I've worked with most major distributions since the mid-to-late 90s.
POSIX-compliant macOS since 2010. 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) since 2020.
- In the way-back I worked with most major flavors of Unix (including hardware infrastructure planning).

### Cloud

- Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since 2010 this has been my main professional deployment environment. Of course this means
  that I've worked with many of their sub-systems and services.
- I've dabbled in Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Heroku, and more.

## Employment

In a nutshell, I've been a technical leader (architect, chief technologist, manager) since I really found my feet at SPS
Commerce, circa 2000. I've been building Web applications since 1995, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) since 1998, and
cloud-based (e.g. Amazon Web Services) systems since 2010.

- My own software incubator, since 2021. Includes a major [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
  integration project ("Civis Mundi") to make personal banking history available across borders so that immigrants need
  not get stuck into the exploitative high-interest credit card game until they can develop domestic credit history.
- VP Engineering, Planview/Changepoint, 2015-2021.
- CTO and Product Manager, barometerIT, 2011-2015.
- Chief Technologist, International Decision Systems, 2008-2011.
- Senior Technical Architect, Perficient, 2006-2008.
- Technical Architect, MSI Systems Integrators, 2005-2006.
- Chief Architect, Notiva, 2002–2005.
- Technical Architect, SPS Commerce, 1998-2001.
- Renaissance Worldwide, 1998-1998.
- Technical Lead, Minnesota Public Radio, 1995-1998.

## Education

In a nutshell, I started as a computer geek, then went liberal arts until my wife's own graduate degree in archaeology
(Cornell) gave me a dose of reality. I jumped off and joined the Internet revolution.

- Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Master's Degree program with fellowship, 1995, incomplete. Archeology and
  History.
- University of Minnesota. Philosophy.
- Saint Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota. Bachelor of Arts, Magna Cum Laude, 1989. Double-majored in Philosophy and
  History.
- Københavns Universitet, Denmark. History. Study abroad while @ Saint Olaf.
- Minnesota State University. Computer Science. As my father was an administrator here, I was able to use free family
  credits to begin my post-secondary education as a sophomore in high school.
