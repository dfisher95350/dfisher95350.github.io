# TLDR

My skills, experience, employment, and education in a nutshell.

## Skills

- Bridging the gap.
- Keeping it fresh. Don't plan to solutions but rather to solution vectors, so that technology choices can always be
  evolving in a forward direction.
- Keeping it real. Use pragmatic, proven technical solutions for real-world problems. Make smart build v buy decisions.
- Making it personal.

## Experience

### Management

...

### Languages

- Java, since version 1. Name any major language or framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and I've probably
  worked professionally with it. For example, Kotlin and Spring.
- JavaScript, since before it was called JavaScript. I've worked with most of the frontend frameworks, and some of the
  backend. I work with TypeScript and React, for example.
- To a lesser extent, I've also worked professionally in the .NET, Python, and Ruby ecosystems.

### Operating Systems

- Linux, of course. I've worked with most major distributions since the mid-to-late 90s. POSIX-compliant macOS since
    2010.
  [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) since 2020.
- In the way-back I worked with most major flavors of Unix (including hardware infrastructure planning).

### Cloud

- Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since 2010 this has been my main professional deployment environment. Naturally, I've
  worked with many of their sub-systems and services.
- I've dabbled in Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Heroku, and more.

## Employment

In a nutshell, I've been a technical leader (architect, chief technologist, manager) since I really found my feet at SPS
Commerce, circa 2000. I've been building Web applications since 1995, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) since 1998, and
cloud-based (e.g. Amazon Web Services) systems since 2010.

- My own software incubator, since 2021. Includes a major [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)
  integration project ("Civis Mundi") to make personal banking history available across borders so that immigrants need
  not get stuck into the exploitative high-interest credit card game until they can develop domestic credit history.
- VP Engineering, Planview/Changepoint, 2015-2021.
- CTO and Product Manager, barometerIT, 2011-2015.
- Chief Technologist, International Decision Systems, 2008-2011.
- Senior Technical Architect, Perficient, 2006-2008.
- Technical Architect, MSI Systems Integrators, 2005-2006.
- Chief Architect, Notiva, 2002–2005.
- Technical Architect, SPS Commerce, 1998-2001.
- Renaissance Worldwide, 1998-1998.
- Technical Lead, Minnesota Public Radio, 1995-1998.

## Education

In a nutshell, I started as a computer geek, then went liberal arts until my wife's own graduate degree in archaeology
(Cornell) gave me a dose of reality. I jumped off and joined the Internet revolution.

- Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Master's Degree program with fellowship, 1995, incomplete. Archeology and
  History.
- University of Minnesota. Philosophy.
- Saint Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota. Bachelor of Arts, Magna Cum Laude, 1989. Double-majored in Philosophy and
  History.
- Københavns Universitet, Denmark. History. Study abroad while @ Saint Olaf.
- Minnesota State University. Computer Science. As my father was an administrator here, I was able to use free family
  credits to begin my post-secondary education as a sophomore in high school.
