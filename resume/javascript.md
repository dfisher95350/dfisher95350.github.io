# JavaScript

_(This page is incomplete. WIP Aug 2020.)_

My first experience with JavaScript was in 1997, with LiveWire in the Netscape Enterprise Server. Netscape provided both technology and funding to launch mpr.org (Minnesota Public Radio) -- particularly to create a Web presence for, and netcast of, A Prairie Home Companion. Ironically, LiveWire was a server-side programming environment -- while at the same time, Java was being used for browser-based "applets".
