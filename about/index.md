# About Me

I've worn many hats in and around software engineering. Throughout, I've always kept one foot in the codebase, even when
bridging into people management, product management, and pragmatic marketing.

Bridging quality engineering into quality product (and vice-versa) has been my chief professional interest.

I have more than 20 years of software development experience in diverse business domains. I've designed and implemented
sophisticated, high-volume, business-critical systems. I've set product and technology vision and planned technical and
product roadmaps.

My comfort-zone is deep and broad: low-level code to high-level design. I lead teams and mentor developers. I have
strong abilities to document, prioritize, and organize, as well as excellent communication skills.

## Personal Trivia

Out of college, I played key roles in two Minnesota institutions.

I was the main contributor in the team that founded [mpr.org](https://www.mpr.org/)
for [Minnesota Public Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio). The Web presence then was much more
ambitious than it is today. At the time (based on the popularity
of [A Prairie Home Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Prairie_Home_Companion))
[Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) made significant financial, hardware, and software contributions. We
were provided resources for interesting new projects, including pioneering early video netcasts. This is where I started
with **Java** and **JavaScript**. (This was also the heyday of [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).)

Before that, I was a book buyer (and book seller) for **Odegard Books of Minneapolis** until Dan Odegard closed up in
the face of expansion by national chain stores. In its day, Odegard Books of Minneapolis was one of the great
independents (think Powell's of Portland). This is where I discovered and dove into many of my favorite authors of
classic fiction.

My computing experiences date back to my childhood. My very first personal computer was
the [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), followed by
the [Apple II Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_Plus).
[Apple BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC) was the first programming language with which I spent
significant time. During my high school years, I studied **Computer Science**
at [Minnesota State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University,_Mankato).
