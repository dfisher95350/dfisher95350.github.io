# About Me

I've worn many hats in and around software engineering. Throughout, I've always kept one foot (at least) in the codebase, even when bridging into people management, product management, and pragmatic marketing.

Bridging quality engineering into quality product (and vice-versa) has been my chief professional interest.

I have more than 20 years of software development experience in diverse business domains. I've designed and implemented sophisticated, high-volume, business-critical systems. I've set product and technology vision and planned technical and product roadmaps.

My comfort-zone is deep and broad: low-level code to high-level design. I lead teams and mentor developers. I have strong abilities to document, prioritize and organize, as well as excellent communication skills.

## Professional Experience

I've held leadership roles in **four Independent Software Vendors (ISV)**, including **two greenfield startups**.

I've gained diverse experience as a technical consultant for **three consulting groups**.

## Personal Trivia

Out of college, I played key roles in two Minnesota institutions.

I was the main contributor in the small team that founded **mpr.org** for **Minnesota Public Radio**. The Web presence then was actually much more ambitious then than it is today. At the time (based on the popularity of "A Prairie Home Companion") **Netscape** made significant financial, hardware, and software contributions. We were provided resources for interesting new projects, including pioneering early video netcasts. This is where I started with **Java** and **JavaScript**. (This was also the heyday of **Perl**.)

Before that, I was a book buyer (and book seller) for **Odegard Books of Minneapolis** until Dan Odegard closed up in the face of expansion by national chain stores. In its day, Odegard Books of Minneapolis was one of the great independents (think Powell's of Portland). Obviously, this is where I discovered and dove into many of my favorite authors of classic fiction.

My computing experiences date back to my childhood. My very first personal computer was the Sinclair ZX81, followed by the **Apple II Plus**. Apple BASIC was the first programming language with which I spent significant time. My father had a quota of free credits at Minnesota State Mankato, which I used to study Computer Science during my high school years.
