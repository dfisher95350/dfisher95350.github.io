# My Repositories

_(This page is incomplete. WIP Nov 2020.)_

I have a number of **private repositories** for self-study, etc. These repositories reflect both my technical experience and technical interests.

What follows is an overview. 

## General

- notebook - A repository of documents and notes on general topics in technology: concepts, patterns, providers, resources, standards, and tools. Also contains general information on data science, data stores, and data structures.

## Dev

My professional experience revolves chiefly around the ecosystems of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and **JavaScript**. Happily, these ecosystems are _extremely rich_ and still evolving. My work has kept me hands-on with the most relevant technologies in both spaces from 1996 to the present.

- [java](./java.md) - My professional experience with languages and frameworks in the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** dates back to applets in version 1 (1996). This repository includes many things, from `Akka` to `ZooKeeper`. Highlights include `Kotlin` and `Spring`.
- [javascript](./javascript.md) - My professional experience with **JavaScript** dates back to LiveWire in the Netscape Enterprise Server (1997). This repository includes languages and frameworks like `TypeScript` and `React`.
- cpp - C++
- dotnet - Particularly **.NET Core** on Linux and macOS.
- [go](./go.md)
- [python](./python.md)
- [ruby](./ruby.md)
- [rust](./rust.md)
- [unity](./unity.md)

## DevOps

I have long professional experience with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, including `Chef` in OpsWorks. My chief interest in this area revolves around what these technologies mean for packaging and delivering components in repeatable, standards-based fashion. You'll see that reflected in my repositories here.

- [docker](./docker.md)
- [kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)
- [vagrant](./vagrant.md)
- [my_env](./my_env.md)
