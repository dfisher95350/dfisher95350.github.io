## VP of Engineering

**Changepoint** Apr 2015 – Present

In April 2015, Changepoint acquired barometerIT. My efforts were instrumental in getting barometerIT recognized in markets closely aligned with Changepoint's own PPM space. Changepoint's portfolio now includes three major products: Changepoint PSA, Daptiv PPM, and barometerIT EAM.

My role with Changepoint has been to continue the development, operation, and support of barometerIT. I've continued to guide and manage most aspects of the product. Most importantly, I leveraged customer relationships into designs for product enhancement, and then realized those designs in product engineering (and finally, guided them to production and provided ongoing support). Chief roles have continued to include product manager and chief technologist.

We built our team around an ethic of close customer care blended seamlessly with ambitious software innovation. barometerIT continues to serve a number of "Fortune 100" companies in North America -- and now "Global 500" companies in other geographies worldwide.

In the role of product manager: Helped to nurture customer relationships in order to maintain an extremely high retention rate. Transitioned fresh product ideas rapidly into functional prototypes, and then quickly into shippable software. Continuously ensured that technical debt was always addressed in the context of marketable product gains. Kept the software fresh and relevant -- always a concern in independent software vendors.

In the role of chief technologist: Led engineers in the Java and JavaScript ecosystems, as well as DevOps on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Key frameworks and tools included React, Redux, Cytoscape, Node.js, Spring (and nearly all of the Spring sub-frameworks, including Data Flow), Hibernate, Tomcat, Solr, MySQL, and Neo4j. Particularly, I continued to lead the transition from Solr and MySQL to a true graph solution with Neo4j.


## Chief Technologist and Product Manager

**barometerIT** Mar 2011 – Mar 2015

barometerIT was a greenfield startup Independent Software Vendor (ISV) created by a number of the leading salespersons and engineers from the Perficient consultancy (formerly Javelin) in Minneapolis. The product is designed to help medium to large-sized enterprises to bridge the gap between Business and IT concerns.

This startup turned out to be an excellent opportunity to wear "many hats". I eventually assumed the roles of both Chief Technologist and Product Manager to guide barometerIT into a market space alternately known as "Integrated IT Portfolio Management (IIPA)" and "Enterprise Portfolio Management (EPM)". Not only did this guidance help barometerIT acquire and keep a number of Fortune 100 companies in North America -- it led directly to barometerIT's acquisition by Changepoint in 2015.

In the role of Product Manager: Applied the Pragmatic Marketing Framework in conjunction with Enterprise Architecture (EA) expertise to improve and market the barometerIT software platform. Was instrumental to obtaining Gartner "Cool Vendor" and "Magic Quadrant" presence. Performed market analysis, followed news and trends, synthesized and shared findings. Translated those things into inputs for product pipeline. Participated in relevant associations (ISACA and EA forums). Designed processes, patterns, fields, rules, and reports to help realize enterprise management goals. Developed a reproducible product implementation and services model. Delivered market thought leadership (communications, white papers, social media). Acted as a customer and market-facing interface (often acting as “proxy EA”).

In the role of Chief Technologist: Led engineers in the Java and JavaScript ecosystems, as well as DevOps on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Key frameworks and tools included AngularJS, Wicket, Hibernate, Spring, Infinispan, JBoss, Amazon Web Services platform (AWS), ActiveMQ, Mule, Solr, MySQL, and Neo4j.
